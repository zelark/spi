Sipmple Pascal Interpreter
==========================
This is a simple interpreter, which I have been writing in Java. It's based on a series "[Let's build a simple interpreter] (https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)". The series is great. I highly recommend it to you.

For now, the interpreter can handle with only integers and supports following stuff:
- binary operations: +, -, *, /;
- unary operations: +, -;
- parenthesized expressions with arbitrary depth nesting.
